        </h1>
        <p>This is a tutorial meant to give an introduction for the UE4 flow path plugin, which can be purchased <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/particle-editor-extension">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>
          <a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation
        </h2>
        <p>Just use the Unreal Engine Launcher, where the plugin should be available in your library after the purchase. If you only have an archive file then extract it to your engine's plugin folder, e.g. <br><span class="code">C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\4.18\Engine\Plugins</span>.</p>
        <p>You can also add the plugin directly to your project (e.g. when you want to adjust the source code of the plugin). To do that, create a "Plugins" folder in your project folder (where your .uproject file is) and drop the plugin in there.</p>
        <p>After the installation, you should see the plugin in your engine's plugin view, like <a href="media/plugins.jpg">this</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following gives an overview of the plugin's features and how to use them.

          How does it work</h3>
        <p>
          This plugin features an <a href="http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro/GameAIPro_Chapter23_Crowd_Pathfinding_and_Steering_Using_Flow_Field_Tiles.pdf">advanced pathfinding algorithm</a> to
          steer a large amount of agents through a dynamic environment with minimal performance cost.

          Setup</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Requirements</b>
          Before the plugin can be used, make sure that you can check off all of the following points:
          <ul>
            <li>UE4 comes with a <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/ContentExamples/NavMesh/index.html">built-in navigation system</a> based on navmeshes.
            Check it out and see if it does not already fit your needs.</li>
            <li>The whole navigable surface must be divided into a 2D grid where each grid cell has a cost value associated with it.</li>
            <li>The plugin's navigation can only work with 2D surface data (e.g. a top-down view of a map).</li>
            <li>The plugin does not automatically sync any network calls or data. Syncing the positions and velocities of any pawns and surface data is still your responsibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

          FlowPathManager configuration</h3>
        <p>
          <p>
            The <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span> is the main interface to control the plugin's functions.
            It handles the surface data, path generation and updates the registered agents each tick with new movement input.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following gives a detailed view of the options and methods for FlowPathManager:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><div class="parameter">tileLength</div></dt>
            <dd>The size of a tile. Each tile consists of individual cells, which have a movement cost attached.
              Bigger tiles increase performance and memory needs, but lead to smoother pathfinding and less "jumps" between tiles.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">WorldToTileTranslation</div></dt>
            <dd>The translation to convert a world position into a tile position (e.g. <span class="code">(100, 250) -> (105, 255)</span>).
              This is used to align the plugin's internal tile coordinates and data representation with the game world.<br>
              Tip: to check that the internal representation fits the world geometry, enable the debug drawing options.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">WorldToTileScale</div></dt>
            <dd>The scale to convert a world position into a tile position (e.g. <span class="code">(100, 250) -> (1, 2.5)</span>).
              This is used to align the plugin's internal tile coordinates and data representation with the game world.
              A small scale means that the same patch of a world should be represented with more tiles, which allows for more granular pathfinding, but also
              requires a lot more memory and processing resources.<br>
              A good measure for the scale is that each resulting cell coordinate fits one agent.<br>
              Tip: to check that the internal representation fits the world geometry, enable the debug drawing options.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">AcceptanceRadius</div></dt>
            <dd>The world-distance to the target at which the pathfinder marks a query as finished.</dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">LookaheadFlowmapGeneration</div></dt>
            <dd>If true then flowmaps can be generated with data from the tiles around them by 'looking ahead' in a 2x2 tile grid.
               This leads to higher quality flowmaps, but it also increases the calculation times and a flowmap also becomes invalid if a neighbor tile is changed.
               <p>
               See the following example, where each letter is a different tile:
<pre>
|A|B|C|   Agent wants to go from tile A to tile I.
+-+-+-+   Calculated tile path: A -> B -> E -> F -> I
|D|E|F|
+-+-+-+
|G|H|I|
</pre>
              Without the lookahead flowmap generation, an agent standing on tile A will always go just right, because the next tile on its path is tile B to the right.
              With the lookahead flowmap, the agent will try to go directly to tile E (which comes after B as a waypoint) and so goes down and to the right.
              To generate this lookahead flowmap, date from tiles A, B, D and E is necessary (instead of just A).
              </p>
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">MergingPathSearch</div></dt>
            <dd>If true then agents with the same goal will reuse each others path search results, which has two benefits:<br>
              1. It is faster.<br>
              2. Units tend to group together as they try to use similar paths.<br>
              The drawback is that it can lead to suboptimal paths for some units.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">CollisionChecking</div></dt>
            <dd>If true then agents will try to avoid collisions by steering to nearby free cells and reducing velocity.
              Enabling this option has a negative performance impact.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">GeneratorThreadPoolSize</div></dt>
            <dd>The number of thread that should be used to generate flowmaps.
              A number <= 0 disables threaded flowmap generation.<br>
              If a flowmap for a tile was not generated (e.g. because threaded generation is disabled) before it is requested, the generation is done on the tick thread.
              Too many flowmap generations per tick can lead to performance problems.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">MaxAsyncFlowMapUpdatesPerTick</div></dt>
            <dd>The max number of precomputed flowmaps that are written per tick. This is mainly used to smooth the updates over a few ticks to prevent lag spikes.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">CleanupFlowmapsAfterTicks</div></dt>
            <dd>The number of ticks that need to pass before all cached and unused flowmaps are deleted to reclaim memory.
              A negative value means flowmaps will never be deleted once created (as long as the source data has not changed).
            </dd>

          </dl>
