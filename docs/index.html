        </h1>
        <p>This is a tutorial meant to give an introduction for the UE4 flow path plugin, which can be purchased <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/particle-editor-extension">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>
          <a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation
        </h2>
        <p>Just use the Unreal Engine Launcher, where the plugin should be available in your library after the purchase. If you only have an archive file then extract it to your engine's plugin folder, e.g. <br><span class="code">C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\4.18\Engine\Plugins</span>.</p>
        <p>You can also add the plugin directly to your project (e.g. when you want to adjust the source code of the plugin). To do that, create a "Plugins" folder in your project folder (where your .uproject file is) and drop the plugin in there.</p>
        <p>After the installation, you should see the plugin in your engine's plugin view, like <a href="media/plugins.jpg">this</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following gives an overview of the plugin's features and how to use them.

          Setup</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Requirements</b><br>
          Before the plugin can be used, make sure that you can check off all of the following points:
          <ul>
            <li>UE4 comes with a <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/ContentExamples/NavMesh/index.html">built-in navigation system</a> based on navmeshes.
            Check it out and see if it does not already fit your needs.</li>
            <li>The whole navigable surface must be divided into a 2D grid where each grid cell has a cost value associated with it.</li>
            <li>The plugin's navigation can only work with 2D surface data (e.g. a top-down view of a map).</li>
            <li>The plugin does not automatically sync any network calls or data. Syncing the positions and velocities of any pawns and surface data is still your responsibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Getting started</b>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The central class of the plugin's API is <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span>, which has to be instanciated as an actor in the level.
                  To do that, create a new blueprint or C++ class that extends <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span>:<br>
                  <img src="media/CreateManagerBP.jpg" alt="CreateManagerBP"><br>
                  Next, give your custom manager a fancy name and add it to the level:<br>
                  <img src="media/AddManagerToLevel.jpg" alt="AddManagerToLevel"><br>
                  When the game begins (and every time you want to change the tile size during the game), the manager must be initialized.
                  During the initialization, the manager prepares the necessary data structures, creates threads for async flowmap generation and reads the config parameters.
                  After the initialization, the manager can be filled with surface data (more on that later).
                  In this example, I initialize the manager after the game begins and initialize it from a greyscale texture:<br>
                  <img src="media/InitManagerWithTexture.jpg" alt="InitManagerWithTexture"><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To represent my level's geometry, I added a simple flat mesh to the level and slapped the surface cost texture on it (just imagine the black parts to be crates and walls):<br>
                  <img src="media/CubeGround.jpg" alt="CubeGround"><br>
                  It is important to check that the manager's internal representation of the data is in sync with the real world space.
                  This means that the manager's <span class="code">WorldToTileTranslation</span> and <span class="code">WorldToTileScale</span>
                  properties must be set correctly to convert world coordinates into tile coordinates.
                  You can easily check if that is the case by enabling the debug draw options on the manager.
                  This will draw the tiles, their connections (portals), the blocked cells and optionally even more.
                  The following example shows how the debug drawings align with the level geometry:<br>
                  <img src="media/ManagerDebugDraw.jpg" alt="ManagerDebugDraw"><br>
                </p>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>One of the most important parts of a good navigation outcome is good surface data quality.
                The whole navigable area is divided into tiles, which are divided into individual cells with a cost value:<br>
                <img src="media/surface.svg" alt="surface"><br>
                <p>
                  Cells can have a cost value between 1 and 255 (0 is reserved and not allowed).
                  A value of 1 means almost free traversal and 254 has the highest traversal cost possible.
                  For example, an agent would rather cross 99 tiles of cost 1 than 1 tile of cost 100.
                  A value of 255 means that a cell is <b>blocked</b> and cannot be traversed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is advisable to avoid very sharp jumps of cost values and have instead cost gradients.
                  See the above example: the easy to traverse cells never directly touch the blocked cells, but have a gradient of hard to traverse cells instead.
                  This leads to more naturally looking paths (you don't try to hug any walls while walking) and prevents agents from colliding easily with blocked areas.
                  Depending on the velocity of the agents, the "buffer zone" of high-cost cells around a blocked area can even be more than one cell wide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the start of the game, you supply the <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span> with all the individual tiles.
                  The data for each tile is given as a continuous array of values between 1 and 255.
                  During the game, new tiles can be added or existing tiles updated.
                  Note that single cells cannot be directly updated, it is only possible to replace complete tiles.
                  To update a single tile, use the methods <span class="code">UpdateMapTileWorld()</span> or
                  <span class="code">UpdateMapTileLocal()</span> on a <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span> instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the map data is known at development time (i.e. the map is not procedurally generated) then one very convenient way to provide the data is via texture.
                  This has the added benefit that the cost data can be inspected and manipulated with software such as <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.
                  That way you can also easily add effects such as blurring to the cost data to give the map a more natural feel.
                  To create the surface data from a texture, use the method <span class="code">UpdateMapTilesFromTexture()</span>
                  on a <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span> instance.
                </p>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Next, we need to make the <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span> aware of our pawns.
                In our pawn's blueprint we add the <span class="code">FlowPath Component</span> to it:<br>
               <img src="media/FlowPathComponent.jpg" alt="FlowPathComponent"><br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>We have to enable the component at the start of the game by providing it with a <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span>.
                You can have several managers, e.g. for different players or for different types of units (sea units have a different manager than land units).
                The component automatically registers itself with the manager and updates the pawn with the movement input.
                You can use the following code if you have just one global manager is your map:
                <img src="media/SetComponentManager.jpg" alt="SetComponentManager"><br>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>We can then use the component's <span class="code">MovePawnToTarget</span> method to set a target for our pawn.
                For example, to move all pawns to a point on the ground when the left mouse button is clicked, you can do the following in your Controller blueprint:
                <img src="media/MoveOnLeftClick.jpg" alt="MoveOnLeftClick"><br>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </p>

          NavAgent configuration</h3>
        <p>
          <p>
            The <span class="code">NavAgent</span> is the interface implemented by actors that want to move around with the help of the plugin.
            It allows the <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span>, once registered, to obtain information about the agent's state and update it with movement input.
            For example, the <span class="code">UFlowPathComponent</span> pawn component implements the <span class="code">NavAgent</span> interface to control and navigate pawns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following gives a detailed view of the options and methods for the <span class="code">NavAgent</span> interface:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><div class="parameter">GetAgentInfo()</div></dt>
            <dd>Returns the up-to-date info on this agent. This includes the agent's current location and target in worldspace.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">UpdateAcceleration(FVector2D newAcceleration)</div></dt>
            <dd>Updates the direction this agent should move to in order to reach its target.
              The vector is normalized to a length between 0 and 1.
              The size of the vector is correlated with the velocity the agent should move with, i.e. a smaller vector means the agent should move slower.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">TargetReached()</div></dt>
            <dd>This method is called once if the agent has reached the target location (within the acceptance radius).
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">TargetUnreachable()</div></dt>
            <dd>This method is called once if the agent has a target location that cannot be reached.

          FlowPathManager configuration</h3>
        <p>
          <p>
            The <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span> is the main interface to control the plugin's functions.
            It handles the surface data, path generation and updates the registered agents each tick with new movement input.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following gives a detailed view of the options and methods for <span class="code">FlowPathManager</span>:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><div class="parameter">tileLength</div></dt>
            <dd>The size of a tile. Each tile consists of individual cells, which have a movement cost attached.
              Bigger tiles increase performance and memory needs, but lead to smoother pathfinding and less "jumps" between tiles.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">WorldToTileTranslation</div></dt>
            <dd>The translation to convert a world position into a tile position (e.g. <span class="code">(100, 250) -> (105, 255)</span>).
              This is used to align the plugin's internal tile coordinates and data representation with the game world.<br>
              Tip: to check that the internal representation fits the world geometry, enable the debug drawing options.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">WorldToTileScale</div></dt>
            <dd>The scale to convert a world position into a tile position (e.g. <span class="code">(100, 250) -> (1, 2.5)</span>).
              This is used to align the plugin's internal tile coordinates and data representation with the game world.
              A small scale means that the same patch of a world should be represented with more tiles, which allows for more granular pathfinding, but also
              requires a lot more memory and processing resources.<br>
              A good measure for the scale is that each resulting cell coordinate fits one agent.<br>
              Tip: to check that the internal representation fits the world geometry, enable the debug drawing options.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">AcceptanceRadius</div></dt>
            <dd>The world-distance to the target at which the pathfinder marks a query as finished.</dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">LookaheadFlowmapGeneration</div></dt>
            <dd>If true then flowmaps can be generated with data from the tiles around them by 'looking ahead' in a 2x2 tile grid.
               This leads to higher quality flowmaps, but it also increases the calculation times and a flowmap also becomes invalid if a neighbor tile is changed.
               <p>
               See the following example, where each letter is a different tile:
<pre>
|A|B|C|   Agent wants to go from tile A to tile I.
+-+-+-+   Calculated tile path: A -> B -> E -> F -> I
|D|E|F|
+-+-+-+
|G|H|I|
</pre>
              Without the lookahead flowmap generation, an agent standing on tile A will always go just right, because the next tile on its path is tile B to the right.
              With the lookahead flowmap, the agent will try to go directly to tile E (which comes after B as a waypoint) and so goes down and to the right.
              To generate this lookahead flowmap, data from tiles A, B, D and E is necessary (instead of just A).
              </p>
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">MergingPathSearch</div></dt>
            <dd>If true then agents with the same goal will reuse each others path search results, which has two benefits:<br>
              1. It is faster.<br>
              2. Units tend to group together as they try to use similar paths.<br>
              The drawback is that it can lead to suboptimal paths for some units.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">CollisionChecking</div></dt>
            <dd>If true then agents will try to avoid collisions by steering to nearby free cells and reducing velocity.
              Enabling this option has a negative performance impact.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">GeneratorThreadPoolSize</div></dt>
            <dd>The number of thread that should be used to generate flowmaps.
              A number <= 0 disables threaded flowmap generation.<br>
              If a flowmap for a tile was not generated (e.g. because threaded generation is disabled) before it is requested, the generation is done on the tick thread.
              Too many flowmap generations per tick can lead to performance problems.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">MaxAsyncFlowMapUpdatesPerTick</div></dt>
            <dd>The max number of precomputed flowmaps that are written per tick. This is mainly used to smooth the updates over a few ticks to prevent lag spikes.
            </dd>

            <dt><div class="parameter">CleanupFlowmapsAfterTicks</div></dt>
            <dd>The number of ticks that need to pass before all cached and unused flowmaps are deleted to reclaim memory.
              A negative value means flowmaps will never be deleted once created (as long as the source data has not changed).
            </dd>
